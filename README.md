# EPIC-CS

EPIC-CS is a Team EPIC tool for maintaining consistent code style setup across a variety of projects.

## Global Installation and Usage

It is intended that you install EPIC-CS globally to be used across your projects.
It does not need to be a dependency of your project.

```shell
npm install -g epic-cs
```

To use EPIC-CS, change directory to the root of your project and run:
```shell
epic-cs
```

For now, it will just copy the latest .editorconfig file to the root of your project.
